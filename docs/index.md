# The Python Programming Language

One of the things I wish to see more when writing Python code is better ways to learn and write clean code the _hard_ way. Although "Learn Python the Hard Way" has been divisive in the community, I was one of the people who was undoubtedly influenced when learning the language as an additional programming language.

When going through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), it suddenly showed me how I would have liked to learn style and approach. This book is an attempt to capture the essence of both "Learn the Hard Way" and the Rust book style of a python book.

Of course this book will offer an opinionated take - though my hope is that the reader will gain new perspective in writing Python code, and serve as a reference to how I like to think about my own toolchain and thought process. Furthermore part of my journey within this book is to help bridge my Python and Rust knowledge, to discuss the differences and nuances and also perhaps help Python programmers migrate to Rust themselves.

Thank you so much for reading.
