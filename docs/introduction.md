# Introduction

Welcome to my _Python Book_, which is an introductory book about Python 3. We hope that by reading this book, it helps you write cleaner, more reliable Python code, and enable you to bridge Python to Rust.

# Who This Book Is For

This book assumes that you have written some code in another programming language. It is most definitely not designed as a beginner book in programming. If you are starting your programming journey, there are probably better books to consider.

# How to Use This Book

In general we assume the book is read sequentially, but of course feel free to skip ahead, and jump back - whatever works for you!
